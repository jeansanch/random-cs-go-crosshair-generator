# random-cs-go-crosshair-generator

Just a fun small project that I've made, it generates a .cfg file that can be run in the cs:go console.

## How to use it

Run the .exe file, it will ask for the full path of the cfg folder. 
i.e. "D:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg"
and click enter.

Then it will ask you for the reroll time (in seconds), then click enter and you're done.
The code is now running, to stop the code, just close the cmd window where it is running.
